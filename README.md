# Azure_StaticWebsite_Project
This project demonstrates a simple static website hosted on Azure Blob Storage. It showcases the use of Azure cloud services for website hosting, using the free tier to minimize costs. The website includes basic HTML and CSS, and is intended to highlight my ability to set up and deploy a static site on Azure.
